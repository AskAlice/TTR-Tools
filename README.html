<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-AFK:</strong> Enable/disable by CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+1. The Anti AFK will run even when TTR isn't focused. So you can continue to use your computer. As the AFK is on, the lower graph will show you how often it is ticking the Anti AFK. Every 6 seconds the graph will update, and when the AFK ticks it will spike up for one plot. The Anti-AFK can not be enabled while the trampoline is on. Use the 'Repeat' option to leave the bot on (more info below).
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Settings:</strong></p></li>
<li><p>AFK Time (mins): You can also set the minutes between each Anti-AFK tick. (ie: 2 mins never sleeping) The toon will log out after 12 minutes (2 mins to sleep, 10 mins to log out once sleeping) so the max AFK tick time is 11 minutes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Trampoline Bot:</strong> Enable by CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+2, Disable by CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+3. This is really the main feature of the program so far. I had a prototype working in a few hours, but kept developing the bot to be shiny because it's fun. It will graph the duration of each jump, to see how smoothly the bot is running. Make sure you keep TTR focused (don't tab out) while this bot is running or it won't find the pixels needed (limitation of AutoHotKey).
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Settings:</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Repeat Trampoline: This will let you leave the bot open and walk away as the bot racks up roughly 3200 tokens per hour. It will click away the window that pops up at the end of the trampoline game, walk backwards into the trampoline, then attempt to click the play button (given ping allows, if not then no big deal just wait for it to count down).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gardening Bot:</strong> This feature is a work in progress (initial features released in v1.0.4). Right now, you select which flower you'd like to plant (1-5) with numpad number keys (make sure caps lock is on) while standing next to an empty flower pot, and the bot will select the beans and click plant if it is sure that it has selected the right amount of beans (mostly always this works). Please help me out by reporting any bugs you see into the issue section on this github repository. See the upcoming features section below for planned updates on this. The code is somewhat there, I just need more time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="upcoming-features">Upcoming features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gardening Bot:</strong> I do plan on making it fully automatic so you teleport to home, press a hotkey, and the bot will walk around to each flower pot, optionally watering grown plants, removing grown plants if the pot isn't empty, planting a new flower cycling from flower number 1-5 to 5-1, water the plant once, or a set number of times (ie 2 or 3 if your can is crap and want to train).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>Requires AutoHotKey, pandoc to convert readme.md to html (see line 11 of Gui.ahk). To compile with the icon, use the &quot;Convert .ahk to .exe&quot; utility in the AutoHotKey installation. For debugging I like to use <a href="http://fincs.ahk4.net/scite4ahk/">SciTE4AutoHotkey</a></p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>You may get banned for using this. Although somewhat harmless, some may consider that it gives an 'unfair advantage'. Read the <a href="https://www.toontownrewritten.com/terms">TTR Guidelines to Being Toontastically Toon Enough</a>. I bet TTR could try and detect if a tool like this is running. I've not gotten banned but if this tool becomes popular then TTR's security team will probably look into this.</p>
