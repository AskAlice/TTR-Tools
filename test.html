<p>TTR Tools is a Toontown Rewritten AutoHotKey helper. Currently has Anti-AFK and Toonfest Trampoline bot that maxes every time and can repeat hands free (~6500 tokens/hr)</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-AFK:</strong> Enable/disable by CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+1. The Anti AFK will run even when TTR isn't focused. So you can continue to use your computer. As the AFK is on, the lower graph will show you how often it is ticking the Anti AFK. Every 6 seconds the graph will update, and when the AFK ticks it will spike up for one plot. The Anti-AFK can not be enabled while the trampoline is on. Use the 'Repeat' option to leave the bot on (more info below).
<ul>
<li>Settings
<ul>
<li>AFK Time (mins): You can also set the minutes between each Anti-AFK tick. (ie: 2 mins never sleeping) The toon will log out after 12 minutes (2 mins to sleep, 10 mins to log out once sleeping) so the max AFK tick time is 11 minutes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Trampoline Bot:</strong> Enable by CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+2, Disable by CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+3. This is really the main feature of the program. I had a prototype working in a few hours, but kept developing the bot to be shiny because it's fun. It will graph the jump strength as the bot jumps on the trampoline.
<ul>
<li>Settings:
<ul>
<li>Lagfix (&gt;40): If the 'lag' variable shown above the graph during each jump is more often than not above 40, use this as lag above 40 will make the jumps too late. When the bot is working fine lag is usually around 31, but if for some reason the system is taking longer than usual to search, this option will get rid of some methods that search pixels each time a jump is made to a) see the variation in the color (integrity) and b) verify that the bot is in the trampoline game by looking for the purple pixels at the bottom of the jump bar. This prevents unwanted jumps when bot is enabled but not in trampoline. If you have repeat set to off then stop the bot when walking around.</li>
<li>Repeat: This will let you leave the bot open and walk away as the bot racks up roughly 6500 tokens per hour. It will click away the window that pops up at the end of the trampoline game, walk backwards into the trampoline, then attempt to click the play button (given ping allows, if not then no big deal just wait for it to count down).</li>
